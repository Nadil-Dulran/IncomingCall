# 📞 Incoming Call Simulator

A lightweight Android application developed in **Kotlin** that simulates a mobile phone call workflow. This project demonstrates core Android development concepts, including multi-activity navigation, UI design using ConstraintLayout, and event-driven programming.

## 📱 Features

The application simulates a realistic call flow through three interactive stages:

- **Incoming Call Screen:** Displays caller information with interactive 'Accept' and 'Reject' buttons.
- **Ongoing Call Screen:** Triggered upon accepting a call; displays active call status and an option to hang up.
- **Call Rejected Screen:** Provides visual feedback when a user declines an incoming call.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** XML (View-based)
- **Layout Engine:** `ConstraintLayout` for responsive and flat view hierarchies.
- **Navigation:** Explicit `Intents` for transitioning between activities.
- **Resource Management:** Centralized management of strings, colors, and themes via `res/values` for scalability and localization.
- **State Management:** Implementation of the Android Activity Lifecycle.
