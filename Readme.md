A lightweight Android application developed in **Kotlin** that simulates a mobile phone call workflow. This project demonstrates core Android development concepts, including multi-activity navigation, UI design using ConstraintLayout, and event-driven programming.

- **Incoming Call Screen:** Displays caller information with interactive 'Accept' and 'Reject' buttons.
- **Ongoing Call Screen:** Triggered upon accepting a call; displays active call status and an option to hang up.
- **Call Rejected Screen:** Provides visual feedback when a user declines an incoming call.
